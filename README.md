# Shopping Cart

Shopping Cart with React using [`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com/), [`react-router-dom`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) and [`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/) with the [`React Testing Library(RTL)`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for testing the App.

#### Features:

- add products to the cart;
- filter the products;
- change the quantity of a product in the cart;
- delete a product from the cart;

The App is responsive for other devices.
